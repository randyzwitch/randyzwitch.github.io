It's been a while since the last update, but RSiteCatalyst is still going strong! Thanks to [Wen](https://github.com/slin30) for submitting a [fix](https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/issues/210)/[enhancement](https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/issues/239) to enable the ability to use multiple columns from a Classification within the `QueueDataWarehouse` function. No other bug fixes were made, nor was any additional functionality added.

Version 1.4.16 of RSiteCatalyst was submitted to CRAN yesterday and should be available for download in the coming days.

## Community Contributions
As I've mentioned in many a blog post before this one, I encourage all users of the software to continue reporting bugs via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/issues), and especially if you can provide a working code example. Even better, a fix via pull request will ensure that your bug will be addressed in a timely manner and for the benefit to others in the community.

_Note: Please don't email directly via the email in the RSiteCatalyst package, it will not be returned. Having a valid email contact in the package is a requirement to have a package listed on CRAN so they can contact the package author, it is not meant to imply I can/will provide endless, personalized support for free._
