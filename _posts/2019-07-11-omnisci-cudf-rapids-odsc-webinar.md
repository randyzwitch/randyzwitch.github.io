In this webinar sponsored by the [Open Data Science Conference](https://odsc.com/) (ODSC), I outline a brief history of GPU analytics and the problems that using GPU analytics solves relative to using other parallel computation methods such as Hadoop. I also demonstrate how [OmniSci](https://www.omnisci.com/) fits into the broader GPU-accelerated data science workflow, with examples provided using Python.

Check out the video, grab the Jupyter Notebook from the [odscwebinar](https://github.com/omnisci/odscwebinar) repo and get started with OmniSci and GPU-accelerated data science!
