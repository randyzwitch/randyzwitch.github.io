<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sample Certification Question:</span>

A)  I only

B) I and II

C) I and III

D)  I, II, and III

_You know you're a web analytics geek when:_

I)  You run Google Analytics on multiple blogs, just to practice

II)  You analyze the hell out of your Google Analytics data, even though your blog only gets 100 pageviews per day

III)  Your wife goes out for the evening and you think, "Hmm...I could probably pass the Google Analytics Individual Qualification exam before she gets home"

The answer, sadly, is D.  But I suspect you already knew that 🙂
