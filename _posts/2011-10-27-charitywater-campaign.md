In the past couple of weeks, I've started a project through the <a title="What is the Analysis Exchange?" href="http://www.webanalyticsdemystified.com/ae/what-is-analysis-exchange.asp" target="_blank">Analysis Exchange</a> working with <a title="Jason Thompson" href="http://emptymind.org/" target="_blank">Jason Thompson</a> and <a title="charity:water" href="http://www.charitywater.org/" target="_blank">charity:water</a>.  If you're not familiar with the Analysis Exchange, it's a program where aspiring web analysts and grizzled veterans* volunteer to provide analytics services to charities.  Through the Analysis Exchange, charities are helped, students are mentored, and the World is a slightly better place than when the project was started.

But just because I'm volunteering my time doesn't mean I can't raise some money also.  As we go into the holiday season, I've started a charity:water campaign:

  <strong><a title="charity:water website" href="http://mycharitywater.org/100milesforcharitywater">100 miles for charity:water.</a></strong>
</p>

Find out about the details at [my fundraising website](http://mycharitywater.org/100milesforcharitywater "charity:water website").  As the weeks go by, I'll be publishing a dashboard of the progress, with pictures of each of my runs for proof.  I'll also be including such embarrassing KPI's as avg. time per mile, current weight, and anything else I think of.

I'm already in for 5 miles.  There's only 95 to go.

*Jason is the aspiring web analyst, and I'm the grizzled veteran.  I think.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update:</span>  After Day 1, already 27% of the way to $1000!  I'll start paying off the miles this weekend, but there's still plenty more opportunity to contribute.
