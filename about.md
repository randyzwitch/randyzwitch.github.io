I am Head of Developer Relations at [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), the fastest way to build data apps for Python. This blog covers data science, analytics, and engineering topics I've found interesting over the years as I've worked in varying industries using various open-source technologies. I also am the creator of [JuliaBloggers](https://www.juliabloggers.com/julia-bloggers-submit-feed/), an aggregator site for the Julia programming language community.
