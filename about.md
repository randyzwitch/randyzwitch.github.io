I am Senior Director of Developer Advocacy at [OmniSci](http://omnisci.com), a GPU-accelerated database and analytics platform. This blog covers data science, analytics, and engineering topics I've found interesting over the years as I've worked in varying industries using various open-source technologies.

Currently, my main interests are high-performance computing, especially in regards to GPU technology. I'm also the maintainer of [pymapd](https://pymapd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (OmniSci Python client), [RSiteCatalyst](https://randyzwitch.com/rsitecatalyst/) (R Adobe Analytics client) and too many Julia packages to list individually. Finally, I also am the creator of [JuliaBloggers](https://www.juliabloggers.com/julia-bloggers-submit-feed/), a WordPress aggregator site for the Julia programming language community.
